    <div class="citation">Coyle, Douglas. "The Power of Play: How Video Games Improve Brain Function." <em>Psychology Today</em>, 2014, www.psychologytoday.com/articles/2014.</div>
    <div class="summary">
      This article explores how video games can positively impact brain function. Action games improve reflexes by forcing quick responses to dynamic scenarios. Players develop quicker decision-making and problem-solving skills. It highlights the benefits of gaming in moderation, offering real-world applications of faster reflexes.

    <div class="summary">
      This article presents an NIH study where children playing video games for 3+ hours had better test performance. Brain scans showed increased activity in areas responsible for attention and memory, supporting a link between gaming and cognitive improvements like reaction speed.

    <div class="summary">
      The study shows that players of fast-paced games are better at visual focus and ignoring distractions. The games enhance the ability to handle multiple pieces of information at once, improving visual attention and reaction time—key components of reflexes.

    <div class="summary">
      This article focuses on how games with hand-eye coordination help improve reaction time and motor skills. Games like "Super Mario" train players to respond to visual/auditory cues quickly, showing a strong connection between gaming and physical coordination.

    <div class="summary">
      Powers discusses the mental-physical connection improved by gaming. Sports and rhythm games enhance both timing and hand-eye coordination. These skills transfer well into real-world tasks, such as sports or driving, where fast reflexes are essential.

    <div class="summary">
      The authors highlight how games that demand quick thinking, like simulations and action titles, boost decision-making speed and reflexes. Practicing in virtual environments helps players better respond to real-life challenges quickly and effectively.
